It can be used to automatically stay updated with the most important news in your preferred domain, summarized in a concise format.

The core functionality includes:

Scraping news articles from a specified website.
Summarizing the content using a transformer-based NLP model.
Delivering the summarized content via email or Telegram.
Automated execution via cron or other scheduling tools for periodic execution

Telegram Bot Setup:

Create a Telegram bot by chatting with @BotFather and obtaining your bot token.
Retrieve your unique chat ID by using the Telegram API.
If you need help with this, check out this Telegram bot tutorial.

Gmail App Password (if using email):

If you are using Gmail to send emails, create an app-specific password in your Google account settings (in case you are using 2-step verification).
Replace the email credentials in the script with your Gmail address and the generated app password.
Configuration
Replace the Telegram bot token and chat ID in the script to send updates to your Telegram account.
Set your email credentials (email address and app password) if you choose to use email for delivery.
Scheduling the Script
To schedule this script to run automatically, use cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

For cron, open the terminal and type crontab -e to edit your cron jobs. Add a new line like the following to run it daily at 8:00 AM:

bash
Copy code
0 8 * * * /path/to/your/python3 /path/to/telegram.py
Make sure to replace /path/to/your/python3 and /path/to/telegram.py with your actual file paths.

Features
News Scraping:

The bot scrapes articles from a news website (e.g., OdaTV) by extracting headlines and article links.
This is done using the BeautifulSoup library, which allows for easy navigation of the HTML structure of the page.
Summarization:

The bot uses a transformer-based NLP model (such as T5 or BART) from the Transformers library to summarize the content of each article.
The content is cleaned and truncated to fit within the model's input limits before summarization.
Email/Telegram Delivery:

Once the news articles are summarized, the bot sends the output either as an email or a Telegram message.
If using email, it sends the summaries to a specified recipient using SMTP (Gmail in this case).
If using Telegram, it sends the summaries to the userâ€™s chat ID using the Telegram Bot API.
Automation:

The bot is designed to run automatically at a scheduled time each day (e.g., via cron jobs).
The summaries are delivered to the user at their preferred frequency (e.g., daily).
